Welcome to my Snake Game! 🐍🎮
====================================================================================================================================

## About the Project

🚀 This is a simple Snake game built with Python and the Turtle graphics library! It’s a fun project I’ve worked on to improve my skills in Python and game development. The game features classic Snake mechanics like food collection, collision detection, and score tracking!

### Features:
* 🐍 Snake that grows in length when it eats food
* 🍔 Randomly spawning food
* 🏆 Scoreboard to track your progress
* 💥 Collision detection with the walls and the snake’s body
* 🖤 Simple and clean UI with Turtle graphics

* 🎮 **Game Controls:**
  * Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the Snake

## What's Coming Next?  
I’m actively working on adding more cool features to this game:
* 💯 Store the highest score and keep track of it between sessions
* 🤖 Develop an algorithm that controls the Snake to its maximum length!

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute if you're interested in adding more fun features!
